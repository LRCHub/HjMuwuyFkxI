What's the worst thing that could happen? We could change our minds
That seems to be the hottest topic at this time
Are we sittin' around in the meditation, draggin', chasin'
Or wonderin' who's holdin'? Who's got the will to draw the line?

I know you've got something burning up inside
It's so unhealthy but so good for me (uh!)
Said if I didn't know, and if I didn't know
Well, if didn't know that you loved me, would you tell me?

Well, God only knows our contradictions to quitting
Is a hate-to-love relationship thing
A fire under you is so fulfilling
I fear there's nothing more

I'm givin', givin' you the chokehold
My flirting with disaster is modern love
Ooh, you, you're so bold
My wanting to kiss you still is not enough

I'm gettin' over all the comments
Unfair life statements made by people are nonsense
I'm getting stronger by the minute
And at once I slip into position
I'll swing you and turn you all around

You are the sweetest thing I've found since whenever
You're the only way my time is measured
You might be the silent type but you're advertising louder now
It's crazy how you're killin' me
(Woo!) You're killin' me

But I like your
Red top and matching bottoms
You know the ones, the ones you got on
Put 'em over your skinny self but don't cover your tattoo (Woo!)
'Cause like to look at you, yeah
I love that smell on you
And I got your special place against this face for tasting too

And like it natural
No need for chemicals
Sparkin' it up my senses, you're makin' a sense, you call it sexual
And you're gonna get yours, my lady
Might even be today
And it ain't no thing 'cause I'll be rollin' right along with you

You are the sweetest thing I've found since whenever
You're the only way my time is measured
You might be the silent type but you're advertising louder now
It's crazy how you're killin' me

And give us both a break
And to give us back a taste
When the way things were before they made the laws
And to give us both a chance
But it won't be the last romance
'Cause when the weekend starts, the guilty party's on

Come on
'Til they're kickin' you out, 'til they kickin' you out
Oh, don't stop until another weekend is over
And I'm thinkin' that wanna come closer
Even when I know, I would never, never know

Weekend party's over
Don't stop, let's get closer
Friday, got cold shoulders
Monday, got a new composure

Weekend party's over
Don't stop, let's get lower
I won't blow your cover
Opportunistic lover

Weekend party's over
Don't stop, let's get closer
Friday was mediocre
Monday, I'm self-exposed now

Weekend party's over
Don't stop, let's suppose, ah
I won't blow your cover
Opportunistic lover
